# Challenge-9
README File Generator

## Description
In this Challenge, we were asked to build a fully back-end application that allows users to build their own README file. The contents of this file are built using data that users provide in their query answers.

## Usage
Head over to the index.js file, then right click on it. Select 'open in integrated terminal'. Then, in the terminal that has just appeared. type 'npm i'. This will install node dependencies that will allow the application to run. After this, simply type 'index.js' and follow the prompts that appear in the command line. Finally, check out your newly created README file! Isn't it beautiful?

## Video
Here's a link to a video demonstrating its functionality --> https://drive.google.com/file/d/14cO2b7G60VPbcQYD2o_9DG-jOYrrQtMW/view

## Improvements
In the future, this application could have more functionality regarding the licensing badges, more license choices, and color-coated choices. Thanks!
